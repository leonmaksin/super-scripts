# super-scripts
Welcome to Super Scripts, a collection of productivity scripts that you may find useful :)

Currently, these scripts are only supported on mac. Though this repository is public, there are many components that need to be changed on installation. I'm always happy to help if you would like to try these out though, contact me at lmaksin@umich.edu

Scripts:
1. Close Sites - This script will close your any of your blacklisted websites every minute from chrome
2. Shutdown Watcher - This script will sync to your calendar to shut down your computer on specific trigger events
3. Guest/Incognito Tab Toggler - This script can help you easily toggle access to guest and incognito tabs
